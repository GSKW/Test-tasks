Few novels inspire as much contemplation and feeling on the part of the reader. Hester Prynne, American fiction's first and foremost female heroine continues to haunt this world, inspiring a never-ending stream of scholarly debate. Even in our less puritanical age, some doubtless see her as a villainously great temptress, but to me she is a remarkably brave hero indeed. Her sin is known to all, and she never runs away from it, bearing the scarlet letter on her bosom bravely for all to see; she realizes the true measure of that sin, fretting constantly over the effects it will have on young Pearl, remaining steadfast in her beliefs while at the same time envisioning a new society where women and men can exist on more equal terms, free of the stultifyingly harsh punishments meted out on even the most repentant of souls by Puritanism. She shows her noble spirit by refusing to name her partner in sin and goes so far as to allow the ruthless Roger Chillingworth to torment the man she loves deeply enough to protect him for all time. Little Pearl is somewhat of an enigma, truly manifesting traits of both the imp and the little angel; her questions about the letter her mother wears and the minister who continually holds his hand against his heart reflect an insight that amazes this reader. Chillingworth is a thoroughly black-hearted man; I can certainly understand the blow he sustained as a result of Hester's sin, but his actions and thirst for prolonged revenge on the so-called perpetrator of the wrong he suffered can only be described as roguish and unpalatable.Of course, the most complex character in the novel (and literature as a whole) is the good minister Arthur Dimmsdale. One is compelled to both like him and despise him. He is basically a good man and an unquestionably fine soldier in the army of the Lord, winning many souls to God with his impassioned sermons. He is more aware than anyone else of his sinful nature, and he punishes himself quite brutally in private in a useless attempt to make up for the public ignominy he lacks the moral courage to call upon himself with a public profession of his deed. Dimmsdale is a coward and a hypocrite. At one critical moment in the latter pages of the novel, he blames Hester for his state of misery, and it is that comment in particular that makes this tragic character a man I can only commiserate with to a limited degree. Even at the penultimate moment of the novel, as he finally bears the mark of his shame and guilt for all his parishioners to see, the very men and women who have viewed him as a saintly man of God rather than the brigand he knows himself to be, he does not openly confess-his words and deeds do make plain the secret of his heart, but it is his lack of a thoroughly bold confession that causes some of his most devoted followers, so Hawthorne tells us, to blindly judge his final act as an illustrative parable on the danger of sin threatening each member of his congregation rather than an admission of guilt and self-condemnation.It upsets me to see readers who do not appreciate this novel as one of the earliest and best American classics, a novel that contributed greatly to the establishment of a literary culture in the young country. The language is of a more florid style than today's readers are used to, but this novel is in no way boring. Hawthorne paints some of the most vivid scenes of human drama I have ever witnessed; he writes in such a way that you are there in colonial Boston watching the story play out before your very eyes, struggling to come to terms with your own feelings in regard to such complex and sometimes inscrutable characters. The climactic chapter is truly and deeply moving, more than capable of bringing tears to the eyes of the sensitive soul. The Scarlet Letter is just a brilliant, gripping, thoroughly human novel that I wish everyone could appreciate as much as I do.\",\n       'Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde\\'s motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian\\'s pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil\\'s friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil\\'s new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian\\'s lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author\\'s taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel\\'s motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian\\'s character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde\\'s protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray\\'s are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals. No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves.',\n       'Gordon Comstock is a very good advertising copywriter and a pretty bad poet. But if he indulges his delusion that he can write poetry, he gets tolive a bohemian life of chic poverty, easy morality, and reflexive socialism. Admitting he\\'s really meant to write advertising jingles would requirehim to settle into a respectable, but dreaded, middle class existence of comfort, family, and an aspidistra in the window. The horror, the horror....You can judge who the three most important writers of the last three centuries were by the attempts of both Left and Right to co-opt them and claimthem as their own : Adam Smith (18th Century); Alexis de Tocqueville (19th Century); and George Orwell (20th Century). With the exception ofpeople telling me I\\'m swinish for not thinking that James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, and the James brothers (Henry and William) are geniuses, I\\'dguess that no topic has generated more hostile email to Brothers Judd than our classifying Orwell as a conservative. These hostile correspondentsthough never offer any more evidence than the mere fact that Orwell called himself a socialist and fought against Franco in the Spanish Civil War.It goes almost without saying that they don\\'t refer to his writings, because it is there that their argument falls apart. Nowhere is this more evidentthan in the semi-autobiographical--indeed, Orwell later thought it overly autobiographical--Keep the Aspidistra Flying.The title of the book is awkward and maybe even off-putting, but necessary. Meanwhile, the filmmakers chose an equally appropriate, butmisleading title, for Gordon Comstock is at war on two fronts. The first is with his long-suffering girlfriend, Rosemary, who he hopes to coerceinto bed without marrying :Each laughed with delight at the other\\'s absurdities. There was a merry war between them.The second front is Gordon\\'s war against the money god :What he realised, and more clearly as time went on, was that money-worship has been elevated into a religion. Perhaps it is the onlyreal religion--the only really felt religion--that is left to us. Money is what God used to be. Good and evil have no meaning any longerexcept failure and success. Hence the profoundly significant phrase, to make good. The decalogue has been reduced to twocommandments. One for the employers--the elect, the money-priesthood as it were--\\'Thou shalt make money\\'; the other for theemployed--the slaves and underlings--\\'Thou shalt not lose thy job.\\' It was about this time that he came across The Ragged TrouseredPhilanthropists and read about the starving carpenter who pawns everything but sticks to his aspidistra. The aspidistra, flower of England!It ought to be on our coat of arms instead of the lion and the unicorn. There will be no revolution in England while there are aspidistrasin windows.By God! That sounds like a ringing enough call to arms doesn\\'t it? Except, that is, for the inconvenient title of the novel : Keep the AspidistraFlying. This story, like nearly all of Orwell\\'s, is anti-revolutionary and possessed of both a deep love of middle-class England and a good-naturedcontempt for wealthy socialists (like Comstock\\'s publisher, Ravelston) and all of those (like Gordon himself) who romanticize poverty and thepoor. And so, when Gordon, who by then has been reduced to rather dire straits, finally abandons his life of destitution and the half-written bookof inane poems that he\\'d been writing to resume his advertising job and marry Rosemary, who he\\'s gotten in the family way, it is in no wise adefeat, but a triumph :Now that the thing was done he felt nothing but relief; relief that now at last he had finished with dirt, cold, hunger and loneliness and could getback to decent, fully human life. His resolutions, now that he had broken them, seemed nothing but a frightful weight that he had cast off.Moreover, he was aware that he was only fulfilling his destiny. In some corner of his mind he had always known that this would happen. Hethought of the day when he had given them notice at New Albion; and Mr. Erskine\\'s kind, red, beefish face, gently counselling him not to chuck upa \\'good\\' job for nothing. How bitterly he had sworn, then, that he was done with \\'good\\' jobs for ever! Yet it was foredoomed that he should comeback, and he had known it even then. And it was not merely because of Rosemary and the baby that he had done it. That was the obvious cause,the precipitating cause, but even without it the end would have been the same ; if there had been no baby to think about, something else would haveforced his hand. For it was what, in his secret heart, he had desired.And if that doesn\\'t convince you that the story represents a whole-hearted embrace of bourgeois existence, try this :Our civilization is founded on greed and fear, but in the lives of common men the greed and fear are mysteriously transmuted intosomething nobler. The lower-middle-class people in there, behind their lace curtains, with their children and their scraps of furnitureand their aspidistras--they lived by the money-code, sure enough, and yet they contrived to keep their decency. The money-code as theyinterpreted it was not merely cynical and hoggish. They had their standards, their inviolable points of honour. They \\'kept themselvesrespectable\\'--kept the aspidistra flying. Besides, they were alive. They were bound up in the bundle of life. They begot children,which is what the saints and the soul-savers never by any chance do.The aspidistra is the tree of life, he thought suddenly.Orwell offers up this wisdom with a light touch. He also has the characteristically brutal honesty to portray Comstock (his younger self) as quite ahorse\\'s arse during his bohemian phase. This comes through even more clearly in the film, where Comstock (as played by Richard E. Grant) isnearly difficult to like, prior to his epiphany. It is only when he accepts his own responsibility for the life growing in Rosemary that he comes to be\"fully human\" and likable.Now, if you can reconcile all of that with a belief that Orwell should be considered a man of the Left and not essentially a conservative, kindly dropus a line and explain.

Pode-se imaginar a excitao que a aventura causou no mundo, quando foi publicada pela primeira vez.Al&eacute;m disso, a descrio de Verne sobre o fundo do mar, com suas criaturas maravilhosas e ex&oacute;ticas (polvos, ostras e lulas gigantes) e navios afundados, nos faz lembrar um document&aacute;rio do Discovery Channel.Verne escreveu uma sequncia a este livro: A ilha misteriosa (bora ler...).'],\n      dtype='<U11718')"},"metadata":{}}]}]}
