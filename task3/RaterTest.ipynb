    " \"It is my understanding that this book is widely read in middle and high schools across this country by who I can only assume are impressionable children. My critique of this book is also a bit of advice I offer to the teachers of our youth. Don't go half-way with this book. Golding has done an astouding job depicting the seed of evil that has been planted in every human being since the Garden of Eden slip up. Tell the children who the Lord of the Flies is. But, be careful... This is a very serious book that could have a positive or negative impact on a child. I'm sure that the movie KIDS (written by Harmony Korine) would never be shown in a high school classroom, but really, this book and that movie drive at the same ideas. I'm only asking teachers and administrators to keep this in mind when they decide to make Golding a part of their curriculum, because it would be a perversion of classic literature to water down Golding's dark portrayal of human nature....\",\n",
    " \"I've heard so many people say they've been influenced by Bradbury (writers and others) and I can see why--this is simply a great novel. Bradbury is really a national treasure. If you ever get the chance to hear him speak, don't miss him. His stories are priceless. (Especially the one about his anger at people telling him for years that he was crazy to believe man would set foot on the moon in his lifetime. He said he called up every person who laughed in his face the night Neil Armstrong did--and pretty much laughed in their faces!) There is a fantastic one-on-one interview with him in the Walt Disney Tomorrowland-Disney in Space and Beyond DVD (interviewer is Leonard Maltin). His friendship with Disney (a fellow futurist) was fascinating. But it's the sense of wonder and child-like curiosity and optimism (not childish or blind optimism as he clearly understands what can create a dystopia) that make you realize why he is a national treasure. He's inspired me to look to the future, to look up, to look forward, to always be wary and alert to what can go wrong, (and the dangers of closed or lazy minds) BUT not to let any of that stop you--that anything is possible in a world willing to believe, in a free world with open and curious minds.\",\n",
    " \"Elysian Fields in New Orleans, sweaty, sultry, and steaming, embodies the perfect setting for A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, a play centering on the themes of desire, domination, and destruction. Blanche DuBois epitomized the fading Southern belle, so obsessed with her aging beauty that she refuses to be seen in the glaring light and invents a &quot;make-believe world&quot; where her values endure. Stanley Kowalski represents the brutish, ape-like animal who thrives on women, alcohol, poker, and bowling. Stella Kowalski portrays the gentle sister and wife, torn between her worship of her husband and her loyalty to her fragile sister, Blanche. The action begins as Blanche arrives unexpectedly at the Kowalski's apartment. Immediately, the reader can observe the sexual tension between Blanche and Stanley. The play focuses on the conflict between these two characters, symbolizing the struggle between the gentility of the old Southern values and the brute force of the new, Northern values and also the battle between the nonconformist and conventional society. These themes so often surfaced in Williams's life that before perusing the play, the reader should scan a biography of Tennessee. The reader would be amazed at the incredible similarity between the family and acquaintances of Williams and the characters in his plays. Also, after finshing the play, the reader should rent the 1951 film version, which won the Best Picture Oscar and showcased vibrant, memorable performances by Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, offering a different, more happy ending to the drama. I highly recommend this play not only for its beautiful prose, but for its lasting presence in written classics and its creation of unforgettable characters to which all can relate. This drama would attract the reader who enjoys the local color of New Orleans, violence, biting comedy, insanity, and suspence, for the play constantly keeps the reader guessing at the real reason that Blanche arrived at Elysian Fields and at what will finally happen between Stanley and Blanche. Thus, I advise that the reader follow Blanche and &quot;take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at ---Elysian Fields!&quot;\",\n",
    " '\"I can\\'t even imagine the horror Immacul&eacute;e Ilibagiza, author of Left To Tell, endured during the Rwandan holocaust, having lost her family, her friends, and life as she knew it. Being held captive in the tiniest of bathrooms with 7 other women for 91 days would have been a horrible torture in itself. But she wasn\\'t held captive; she was hiding from people-once friendly neighbors-who wanted to kill her with machetes.Left To Tell isn\\'t solely a story about the one million Tutsis who were viciously slaughtered-a story most Americans never heard about at the time because the big story on television was that O.J. Simpson was arrested. No, this is a story of faith and forgiveness expressed at its highest level. It is one of those stories that makes you re-examine your own life to help you recognize the triviality of what once appeared so wrong, inspiring you to forgive past offenses, and allowing you to appreciate all your blessings. Highly recommended!\"~ Bob Olson, OfSpirit.com Editor',\n",

The characters are all smart, witty and sophisticated. Yes somethings may be a little taboo still but each character faces choices and sometimes our choices are not suppose to proper and prim. The human behavior is indeed something to read about. The characters all work together but then Bushnell throws us a odd duck of a person or those feelings we don't want to hear, which makes the story happen.

    " \"Man's Search for Meaning is considered among the most influential works of psychiatric literature since Freud.It begins with a moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years, and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. The second part of the book describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps and the resulting belief that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. The profound lessons for me from this book are key messages in my workshops and in my book and audio book,Managing Thought: How Do Your Thoughts Rule Your World?-- that what we think is a matter of choice, that no one else and nothing else is responsible or to blame for what we choose to think; and that thoughts of purpose and possibility are powerful thoughts that bring us peace and inspire us and connect us with our highest awareness.\",\n",

I cannot imagine a reader understanding him or his near-obsession with Jamie Fraser if they haven't read the Outlander series. I thought for sure Jamie would show up here and I was disappointed he wasn't in this book. The timelines might have hindered the possiblility, I guess.After getting to know Lord John a bit better here, I will say that Claire Fraser's almost rude treatment of him (in the other books)was uncalled for. John deeply loved Jamie, but he never slept with him, even though Jamie had extended to John a blatant invitation. I think Claire should have commended John and shown him some respect, as very few people would turn down a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be intimate with the person with whom they are in love.\",\n",

There were numbers of similarities between this book and Dickens\\' \"Little Dorrit\", except Hardy appeared to see how many mistaken innuendos, statements never made that could have cleared up false impressions, and misguided moralistic pressures could be fit into one story. All said, I am glad I read \"The Mayor of Casterbridge\". I enjoyed it very much, I just didn\\'t LOVE it.',\n",
    " \"Make this a 2.5 star review because I`ll give Golding the benefit of the doubt that his writing is way over my head. No reason to mark his novel down just because my poor Cro-Magnon pea brain couldn't follow it. However, I expected better execution in the writing from a Nobel Prize winner.The story line and point of view are good. If this isn't a parable about the effect that human contact has with any other species, environment, or place, I don't know what is. Golding gets points for making me ashamed of my own species as he describes what happens when the peaceful Neanderthal world collides with Homo sapiens in very dramatic and unpleasant ways.Perhaps that is his point; the Neanderthals were pushed out of existence because they were not as intellectually developed as their Homo sapiens `Inheritors'.I caught on early that the Neanderthals' `pictures' were personal ideas and memories, and the `shared pictures' are ideas and memories transmitted telepathically. However, Golding tries to describe these pictures in a contrivance of words instead of pictures, and decides to constrain the description of the pictures to the individual's limited perception. That was a noble goal, and done well. However, when he cannot succeed via that route in describing events, he inserts an expository third-person (writer)point of view. That completely confused my pea brain about what was happening. Some scenes are terribly confusing because of this.I likened my experience of reading `The Inheritors' to that of Anthony Burgess' `A Clockwork Orange', which IMHO was a more successful writing experiment. Burgess at least provided us with a glossary to define the futurespeak of his Droog culture. Golding could have invented a word-picture map.I cannot believe that schools are recommending this as a reading assignment. But then in my day they were forcing the dreadful `Catcher in the Rye' on us.\",\n",
    " \"The Outsiders was a fascinating novel depicting the life of a boy struggling to survive in poverty without parents. Having only two brothers to look up to, Ponyboy had to often fend for himself. While trying to stay out of trouble with the Socs, boys from the wealthier side of town, Ponyboy learned to depend on himself and keep his eyes close on his goals even with the many distractions he faced. Many times during this story, Ponyboy got into situations that ended up in fights. While being either strangled, threatened with a knife, or plainly just beaten up, Ponyboy learned to live a hard life. He was rescued in the nick of time, by his brothers, many times. Being the smartest and most focused Greaser of the gang, he set his sights beyond what the average Greaser could imagine. His goal was not to be the best street fighter in the gang but to get an education. He imagined a life free of the hatred between the Greasers and Socs, a life without fear and violence. Many Greasers could not live like that, but Ponyboy could. Ponyboy was different. This story takes us though the winding journey of conflict and heartache in not only Ponyboy's life, but in the lives of those closest to him.I recommend this book to people who would like to know what life in an inner city environment is like. This book will be exciting for all young adults for it addresses topics interesting for this age group. The action and fast paced tempo in the fights, hideaways, and rescues will bring excitement to any reader. This novel will teach any of its readers to be grateful for what they have and due to the many suspenseful moments throughout this novel, it will captivate the reader. I give this book an A+.\",\n",

    " \"An award-winning author and expert on the issues concerning young women and girls, Catherine Dee has again delved into the inner spirits and expansive outer lives of her subject, this time getting to the heart of what makes a young woman's life so enriching: her friendships. The Girls' Book of Friendship is a collection of personal essays, inspirational quotes and heartfelt poetry that shine a light on the bonds that give breath to our being. Not limited to same-age, same-gender peer friendships, The Girls' Book celebrates the sibling, parent and other relative as friend, as well as the often overlooked value in the comradeship found in members of the opposite sex. With celebrity quotes from pop icons including Oprah Winfrey, Madonna, and Sarah Michelle Gellar, The Girls' Book also invokes the likes of Jane Austen, Helen Keller and Alice Walker. Quotes given by a wide range of women -- from a present-day environmental scientist to poets of antiquity -- highlight how the importance of friendship is perhaps one of the few universal truths that breaks all boundaries of time, place, culture, age, religion and race. With Pal Projects like starting a mother-daughter reading group to Friendly Facts and Quick Lists that offer tips on being a good listener and help on evaluating whether or not someone would make a good friend, this 200-page compact pocketbook proves that good things come in small packages. Dee has once again tapped into the playfulness and appreciation of a woman's world while underscoring a common sense of empowerment.\",\n",

    " \"I was highly disappointed with the new translation of The Little Prince. After reading the first page alone, I knew I would be shaking my head throughout. The poetic beauty Katherine Woods extracted from the original French version is missing completely from this new version. Had I never read the Woods version, I would say that this is a good book, but not really a great one. However, since I have read the original, I must say the new one is simply too mundane and easy to read. It's a watered down version of a literary masterpiece.As an elementary school teacher I buy a copy of The Little Prince every June for each of my students as a gift. We read the book together, and we embark on a journey to uncover the mysteries of the universe through the adventures of the interplanetary traveler. It is a fitting way to end a school year. My students love the original language, and they love to construct personal meaning from the text. We have some wonderful discussions about the language and the meaning of the words. Part of the beauty of The Little Prince is pausing momentarily while reading to absorb meaning. I'm afraid the new version leaves very little to the imagination, and leaves little room for juicy conversation.I hope the publisher will continue to publish Woods version, or else I'll have to find another book to give to my students at the year's end.\",\n",

    " 'In the land of opportunity, everyone strives to achieve the ultimate goal: to live the American dream. Of Mice and Men\\'s protagonists George Milton and Lennie Small are no different. John Steinbeck gives his readers the reality of the road to the American dream.George and Lennie dream of owning their own farm and being their own bosses, but they need to work for the money to buy land first. While working on a ranch, they encounter troubles with the boss\\' son, Curley, a hot-headed and aggressive man. These troubles climax with Lennie\\'s accident and merciful end.One of the greatest elements of Steinbeck\\'s novel is his character Lennie Small. Slightly mentally disabled, Lennie is a large but kind-hearted man with the mannerisms of a child. His unshakable, child-like faith in one day owning a farm is the drive of his and George\\'s hard-work. Personally, he is one of the only characters who can provoke emotion from the reader, whether it is pity from Lennie being scolded by George and bullied by Curley, or utter sorrow from the final events of the novel.Steinbeck accomplishes to tell the \"other story\" of pursuing the American dream. Unlike many stories where there are happy endings, Of Mice and Men incorporates some harsh realities of making it big in the land of opportunity. The obstacles that George and Lennie face on the ranch and the heartbreaking ending definitely illustrate such realities.Despite the novel\\'s ending, Of Mice and Men is a great book to read. I would personally recommend readers of high school age or above to read this great tale of two men and their struggles to success.',\n",

    " 'Written in the 1870\\'s and 1880\\'s, \"The Way of All Flesh\" is a semi-autobiographical account of Samuel Butler\\'s life as the son of a clergyman and his attempts to abandon the religious influence of his parents. The protagonist, Ernest Pontifex, is the oldest of three children of the rector of a small English town. His father, Theobald, beats and browbeats his children into learning their hymns while his mother, Christina, solemnly and unsympathetically condones the excessive discipline.Ernest is not much of a scholar and shows a predilection for music (nothing more modern than Handel, though), which his father deems a decadent waste of time. For lack of a better calling, he chooses to become a clergyman like his father and is ordained a deacon after completing Cambridge. As a young man, he runs into some misfortune: He gets suckered into giving much of his money to a smooth-talking charlatan named Pryer, a fellow theologian, to invest, and a turbulent encounter with a prostitute lands him a few months in jail. It is here that he decides a religious path is not for him, which is just as well since he is more of a pragmatist than a dogmatist. He becomes a tailor, but his business fails; he gets married, but his wife turns out to be a lush and a bigamist. If this indeed bears any resemblance to Butler\\'s own life, I shake my head in pity.The narrator is not Ernest himself but his godfather Edward Overton, a close friend of the Pontifex family. Butler probably thought such third-party commentary would provide a more valuable perspective, but it doesn\\'t ring true for Overton to be privy to every single detail of Ernest\\'s life which would not be so easily discovered or revealed. However, Butler is a good writer who peppers his prose with sly sarcasm and humorous observations to counteract its Victorian-style stodginess.For a novel that has a reputation of deconstructing and satirizing the piety of Victorian society, \"The Way of All Flesh\" feels innocuous and tame; what could have been a fiery tirade against religious hypocrisy comes off more as a gentle prodding. For a satire to be successful, the target must be odious and obvious; the book\\'s tone is too dull and soft to inspire the reader to hate the Pontifex family and the religious furor they represent. I respect Butler\\'s motivation for writing this book and I wanted to symphathize with him, but I got nothing more out of it than a recounting of the irrelevant misadventures of an average man from an average middle class family.',\n",

The scenes in which Francisco talks to Reardon, however, are among my favorites in the book.If I was to judge this book solely on its narrative and depth of characterization, it would probably score a 2. But the philosophy is one that very strongly resonates with me.It should of course be noted that even Ayn Rand recognized the simplicity of her characters. Of course, this acknowledement doesn't make them any less shallow.If you consider yourself a lover of freedom, capitalism, or a Libertarian, this should absolutely be on your reading list.\",\n",
    " 'I received this book as a child for my birthday. I read this one twice through. I found it at the time to be very encouraging. I found myself in tears of sorrow and joy at the different circumstances that the author wrote about. The witness of God the Fathers faithfulness is throughout this book. I lost my original copy and I am ordering it to read through a third time.',\n",
    " 'The theory of this book is that you can get through 1 chapter (concept) in one hour, then you take a quiz when your hour\\'s up to make sure you got the concepts.The quizes are poorly worded. Any question that an \"all-of-the-above\" option, was ALWAYS \"all-of-the-above\". Worse than that is that the answers were in the back of the book with NO EXPLAINATION. Please at least tell me why \"b\" was the correct answer.I think the book brushed over some of the essential accounting concepts, while focusing on less important topics.I wish I would have never written in this book, but I guess I\\'m stuck with it now...',\n",
    " \"For a book about formatting, this book itself has a terrible format. Instead of grouping ideas together, it just presents the articles from the author's column in a seemingly random order. It is well-indexed. But all that page turning shouldn't be necessary. It seems not even to have been properly edited/printed - a couple of the pages in the middle are out of order. A more important problem is that a couple of the examples of formatting contain typos or contradict other examples. All of this being said, it still has a wealth of information and is well-worth the read.\",\n",
    " 'This is an over-rated and over-priced book. I am forced to use it, and find that there are better resources available in less expensive texts, and on the W3C School web site. The text is adequate, but barely so. Sell it if you have it, and avoid it if you can.',\n",
    " \"I had heard of this woman agent's escopades long ago, but this book gives a most detailed look at her deeds. And the book still does not tell everything. The author speaks with authority due to his actual coworking relationship with Cynthia, and not just as a coworker. This is true story of a valiant spy of WWII.\",\n",
    " 'through examples of real people, the author explains the different aspects of this disorder. if you want to read about borderline personality disorder start here.',\n",
    " 'Now here\\'s a memoir that all veterans and war history buffs will respect. The Afghan-Russian War may not be one of those \"glamorous\" wars that Hollywood has made popular, but for the young men fighting in it, it was as brutal and senseless as any other.This is the story of Russian soldier Vladislav Tamarov during his 2-year war tour as a mine sweeper. So, how was the life of a Russian mine sweeper in 1984?Short. That\\'s how it was. Walk that field and if you blow up, you found the mine. That\\'s pretty much how you\\'d have had to do it back then, and don\\'t you dare hesitate to make that first step.To us, the privileged generation Nintendo used to war gaming and movies that make wars look \"cool\", the word \"war\" has lost its meaning and we have lost our appreciation for the veteran soldier. In this book, we are reminded of the wounds, not just physical but psychological, that no amount of time, counselling or love can ever heal.Vladislav was an aspiring journalist and had to smuggle his camera into camp because soldiers were not allowed such freedoms. This book tells his tale in a rather rugged style quite fitting of a veteran who lived through hell, and as you pass the pages you see the pictures of his friends, one after another, only to find out a couple of pages later that they blew to pieces.Make no mistake; this memoir is not a cry for help or a pity-me-I\\'m-a-vet type of story. It is not a tale of heroism and triumph against an indomitable foe. It is simply an organized recollection of photographs and notes that a 19-year-old boy took while he was at war with an enemy he did not hate . . . in a country he did not care about . . . for a government that did not care about him.']"
